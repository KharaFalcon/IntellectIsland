# Intellect Island 

A quiz application as part of CS3160 Module(Mobile Development With Android). 

For this project, I used a
technology stack of Android Studio as my integrated development environment(IDE), Jetpack
Compose  as we are focusing on building native application, Material Design 3, to ensure
in both the design and development process it ensures consistent and accessible designs. 

Also
made use of Room Database and Data Access Objects(DAOs) to store data locally within the
app with the SQLite library. For further development, RESTful API could be implemented which
is discussed within the report.
